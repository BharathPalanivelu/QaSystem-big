In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982.

The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs utilizing digital cameras. The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second step of the Factory Project is to catalog everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. All of those items which were photographed and cataloged, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project.

In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies.

Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman\u2013Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event. Various historical secondary sources - Morgan, Chambers, Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory. The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death.

Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples\u2019 from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq\u2019s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.[verification needed]", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 40, "text": "botany and chemistry"}, {"answer_start": 40, "text": "botany and chemistry"}, {"answer_start": 4, "text": "advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry"}], "question": "Developments in which scientists influenced the creation of pharmacology in medieval Islam?", "id": "5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee04"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 131, "text": "Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi"}, {"answer_start": 131, "text": "Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi"}, {"answer_start": 131, "text": "Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi"}], "question": "Who was influential in promoting the use of chemical compounds as medicines?", "id": "5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee05"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 249, "text": "Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi"}, {"answer_start": 249, "text": "Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi"}, {"answer_start": 249, "text": "Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi"}], "question": "Who authored the Liber servitoris?", "id": "5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee06"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1570, "text": "Al-Muwaffaq"}, {"answer_start": 1570, "text": "Al-Muwaffaq"}, {"answer_start": 1570, "text": "Al-Muwaffaq"}], "question": "Who wrote about the distillation of drinking water from sea water?", "id": "5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee08"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1838, "text": "sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate"}, {"answer_start": 1838, "text": "sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate"}, {"answer_start": 1838, "text": "sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate"}], "question": "Which two compounds did Al-Muwaffaq differentiate between?", "id": "5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee07"}]}, {"context": "In Europe there are old pharmacies still operating in Dubrovnik, Croatia, located inside the Franciscan monastery, opened in 1317; and in the Town Hall Square of Tallinn, Estonia, dating from at least 1422.

Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 135, "text": "intracellular pathogenesis"}, {"answer_start": 135, "text": "intracellular pathogenesis"}, {"answer_start": 135, "text": "intracellular pathogenesis"}], "question": "What is the process by which pathogens evade the immune system by hiding inside the host cells called?", "id": "572a0ce11d046914007796fd"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 404, "text": "Salmonella"}, {"answer_start": 404, "text": "Salmonella"}, {"answer_start": 404, "text": "Salmonella"}], "question": "What food bacteria is an example of intracellular pathogenesis?", "id": "572a0ce11d046914007796fe"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 464, "text": "Plasmodium falciparum"}, {"answer_start": 464, "text": "Plasmodium falciparum"}, {"answer_start": 464, "text": "Plasmodium falciparum"}], "question": "What is the eukaryotic parasite responsible for malaria known as?", "id": "572a0ce11d046914007796ff"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 548, "text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"answer_start": 548, "text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"answer_start": 548, "text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}], "question": "What bacteria lives inside a protective capsule that serves to prevent cell lysis?", "id": "572a0ce11d04691400779700"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1166, "text": "protein A"}, {"answer_start": 1139, "text": "G"}, {"answer_start": 1116, "text": "Streptococcus (protein G)"}], "question": "What protein does Staphylococcus aureus produce to make antibodies ineffective?", "id": "572a0ce11d04691400779701"}]}, {"context": "The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated. The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes (amino acids and/or sugars) on the surface of the pathogen, while keeping essential epitopes concealed. This is called antigenic variation. An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response. Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system.

These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach. During Floyd, the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged, and later demolished. The rebuilt pier was later damaged by Fay, but not destroyed. Tropical Storm Bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004, spawning a minor tornado in the process.

The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008.

He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality.

On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"bug-eyed monsters\". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it.

The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost.

Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong \"colonial\" coloration.

Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 197, "text": "electron microscopy"}, {"answer_start": 193, "text": "via electron microscopy"}, {"answer_start": 197, "text": "electron microscopy"}], "question": "How is chloroplast replication observed?", "id": "572969f51d046914007793dd"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 96, "text": "two"}, {"answer_start": 96, "text": "two"}, {"answer_start": 96, "text": "two"}], "question": "How many major chloroplast replication models have been suggested?", "id": "572969f51d046914007793de"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 423, "text": "a theta intermediary form"}, {"answer_start": 425, "text": "theta intermediary form"}, {"answer_start": 423, "text": "a theta intermediary form"}], "question": "What is a Cairns replication intermediate?", "id": "572969f51d046914007793e0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 464, "text": "a Cairns replication intermediate"}, {"answer_start": 332, "text": "double displacement loop"}, {"answer_start": 332, "text": "double displacement loop"}], "question": "What is a D-loop?", "id": "572969f51d046914007793df"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 525, "text": "with a rolling circle mechanism"}, {"answer_start": 530, "text": "a rolling circle mechanism"}, {"answer_start": 525, "text": "with a rolling circle mechanism"}], "question": "How does the D-loop finish replicating?", "id": "572969f51d046914007793e1"}]}, {"context": "In cpDNA, there are several A \u2192 G deamination gradients.

According to Messiaen this way of composing was \"inspired by the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations\".", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 76, "text": "Olivier Messiaen"}, {"answer_start": 76, "text": "Olivier Messiaen"}, {"answer_start": 76, "text": "Olivier Messiaen"}, {"answer_start": 76, "text": "Olivier Messiaen"}], "question": "Which French composer wrote ametrical music using prime numbers?", "id": "5729a3716aef05140015506a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 184, "text": "La Nativit\u00e9 du Seigneur"}, {"answer_start": 184, "text": "La Nativit\u00e9 du Seigneur"}, {"answer_start": 184, "text": "La Nativit\u00e9 du Seigneur"}, {"answer_start": 184, "text": "La Nativit\u00e9 du Seigneur"}], "question": "What is one work by Olivier Messiaen?", "id": "5729a3716aef05140015506b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 219, "text": "Quatre \u00e9tudes de rythme"}, {"answer_start": 219, "text": "Quatre \u00e9tudes de rythme"}, {"answer_start": 219, "text": "Quatre \u00e9tudes de rythme"}, {"answer_start": 219, "text": "Quatre \u00e9tudes de rythme"}], "question": "What is another piece created by Olivier Messiaen?", "id": "5729a3716aef05140015506c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 405, "text": "the third \u00e9tude"}, {"answer_start": 409, "text": "third"}, {"answer_start": 409, "text": "third"}, {"answer_start": 409, "text": "third"}], "question": "In which etude of Neumes rythmiques do the primes 41, 43, 47 and 53 appear in?", "id": "5729a3716aef05140015506d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 504, "text": "the movements of nature"}, {"answer_start": 504, "text": "the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations"}, {"answer_start": 504, "text": "the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations"}, {"answer_start": 504, "text": "the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations"}], "question": "Messiaen says that composition with prime numbers was inspired by what?", "id": "5729a3716aef05140015506e"}]}]}, {"title": "Rhine", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The Rhine (Romansh: Rein, German: Rhein, French: le Rhin, Dutch: Rijn) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein border, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

At the same time, their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamist groups.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 8, "text": "major division"}, {"answer_start": 8, "text": "major division"}, {"answer_start": 14, "text": "division"}], "question": "What exists between fundamentalist Islamism and reformist Islamism?", "id": "572ff86004bcaa1900d76f65"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 299, "text": "Sunni pan-Islamism"}, {"answer_start": 299, "text": "Sunni pan-Islamism"}, {"answer_start": 299, "text": "Sunni pan-Islamism"}], "question": "What did Olivier Roy state underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century?", "id": "572ff86004bcaa1900d76f66"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 527, "text": "sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions,"}, {"answer_start": 527, "text": "sharia"}, {"answer_start": 527, "text": "sharia"}], "question": "What did the Salafi movement put emphasis on?", "id": "572ff86004bcaa1900d76f67"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 706, "text": "democracy"}, {"answer_start": 706, "text": "democracy"}, {"answer_start": 706, "text": "democracy"}], "question": "What has Islamism been increasingly interdependent with following the Arab Spring?", "id": "572ff86004bcaa1900d76f68"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 904, "text": "to maintain their legitimacy"}, {"answer_start": 904, "text": "to maintain their legitimacy"}, {"answer_start": 904, "text": "to maintain their legitimacy"}], "question": "Why do Islamists need democratic elections?", "id": "572ff86004bcaa1900d76f69"}]}, {"context": "Islamism is a controversial concept not just because it posits a political role for Islam but also because its supporters believe their views merely reflect Islam, while the contrary idea that Islam is, or can be, apolitical is an error.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\".

Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region.

The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.
